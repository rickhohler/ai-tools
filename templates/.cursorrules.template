# Cursor Rules for __PROJECT_NAME__

## Documentation Reference
docs_url: __CENTRAL_DOCS__

## Shared Standards
Reference these centralized locations as the source of truth:
- __CENTRAL_DOCS__/standards
- __CENTRAL_DOCS__/patterns
- __CENTRAL_DOCS__/guides

## Core Principles
- Prefer centralized docs as the single source of truth
- Only add project-specific overrides where necessary
- When in doubt, reference the shared standards in __CENTRAL_DOCS__

## Project Context
name: __PROJECT_NAME__
path: __PROJECT_PATH__
domain: __PROJECT_DOMAIN__

## Project-Specific Rules
__ADDITIONAL_RULES__
